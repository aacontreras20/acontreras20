DISCO:
- Bootstap applies default styling and centering of text in container class. 
- Automatically makes it so that longtext wraps around
- Breadcrumb: Allows user to see path to page

QCC:

- features like accordion list and off canvas display 
- Are breadcrumbs good navigation bars?
- Hard to find CDN links for JS in the documentation

Q1:
- personally we preder bootstap as it is more aestheticly pleasing and has a bigger user base.
