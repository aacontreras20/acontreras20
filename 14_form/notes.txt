K14 -- Form and Function/Flask input/took user input from HTML file into python using flask
2021-10-14

Comments:

- The data obtained from the website is stored in a python dictionary. The key is the name defined in the HTML file, and the value is the user input. 

- Data is passed to the app through a query, the python command request args extracts the data from the query, putting it into the dictionary.

- the request method command will return the type of method used to take the data, which is by default GET. 

- the request.args[] function is part of jinja and can be put directly into the HTML without passing it through the python.
